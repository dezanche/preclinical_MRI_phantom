# preclinical_MRI_phantom
This modular phantom is designed for system calibration and quality assurance of preclinical (animal) MRI scanners. Unlike clinical (human-sized) systems, for which the [American College of Radiology](https://www.acr.org/) has standardized the phantoms and measurements, for preclinical applications phantoms with these capabilities do not exist.
This repository contains detailed information in addition to the scientific abstract submitted to the [2022 ISMRM conference](https://www.ismrm.org/22m/).
